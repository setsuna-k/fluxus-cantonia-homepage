    <h1>2nd Anniversary Resolution</h1>

    <p>Fluxus Cantonia has been operating as an ''art collective'' in the last two years; this has turned out to be not ideal for future plans. Thus, the following decisions have been made:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A new political party would be formed:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The name of this political party shall be <b>Action Party Cantonia</b> (<b>APC</b> for short).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    This political party shall be <b>standalone</b>, i.e. the party would not be a part of Fluxus Cantonia and any operation of the party from this point forwards will have no predetermined relationship to Fluxus Cantonia.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The main purpose of this party is to fully inherit the de facto political party function Fluxus Cantonia has been holding during the last two years of its operation.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Starting from the 2nd Anniversary of Fluxus Cantonia, its current only member, Setsuna K, shall become its provisional representative; the process of actual establishment of the party shall officially begin on August 21st August, 2024.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The full formal name of reference, when referring to both Fluxus Cantonia and the new party, shall be <b>Fluxus Cantonia / Action Party Cantonia</b> (<b>FC/APC</b> for short).
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
