      <p>As you may or may not have known, Fluxus Cantonia was established with a manifesto, which I shall include here:</p>
	
      <blockquote>
	FLUXUS CANTONIA MANIFESTO

	<ul>
	  <li>CONSTANT [CRITIQUES & OPPOSITION] OF STATUS QUO.</li>

	  <li>MORE RADICAL THAN RADICALS.<br />
	    HOT. SPICY. EXTREME TO THE LEVEL OF TERRORISTS.</li>

	  <li>RE-INITIALIZE CANTONIAN CULTURE INTO EVERY-DAY LIVES.<br />

	    (cantonian adj. “of Cantonia” “南粵的"; not specifying the Cantonese ethnic group “廣府的", “廣府人的"; )<br />

	    BRING REAL MODERNITY ONTO THE LAND OF CANTONIA; IN THE FORM OF BOTH MODERNITY AND THE CRITIQUES OF MODERNITY.</li>
	</ul>

	2022.8.21
      </blockquote>

      <p>This manifesto is apt (or inevitable) when I still believe that the deconstruction power of leftism could somehow be harnessed to achieve true liberty; however from my personal experience with many leftists throughout this one year and a half, I no longer believe that this is the case. From now on, other than supporting other Cantonian and other Cathaysian separatism activist groups, Fluxus Cantonia has one and only one aesthetic goal only: to establish the <b>New Cantonian Canon</b>.</p>
      <p>Modern progressivism tend to see reactionary as this one big homogeneous blob of "bad" and regressionism; this kind of opinion shows a fundamental lack of understanding in politics and it itself is nothing but a projection of its own, as the canonical definition of "reactionary" is "to return to the status quo ante", and there are a plethora of "status quo ante" one can pursue; by this definition Fluxus Cantonia is reactionary, as it aligns itself with the status quo of "1990s" western liberalism: supportive of the free world, color/gender-blindness on racial/gender topics and a total rejection to intersectionality; it's on this standing that FCAC rejects being labelled as anything other than "centrist" and will work towards true equality and freedom.</p>

      <p>Also, Fluxus Cantonia has been a one-man show for a long time; the reason why I'm still working under this name is that I believe that calling yourself a member of a group - even if that group only has you as its only member - puts you in the correct mindset for doing things, because even if you're unwilling to acknowledge it, when you call yourself a "Cantonian activist" you represent much more than yourself, and as one that represents much more you need to act more appropriately at all time. It's also important to separate FCAC and <a href="https://cantonia.org">ICCA</a> Ireland since they are very different in pretty much every aspects, even if both are run by me and both are still one-man show at this point. I still regret not being able to achieve more as (probably) the only Cantonian representative in the Republic of Ireland in the last lunisolar year since I'm not in a good financial state up till this day; I wish I could have more things to report next year, and I will work harder towards this goal. As for the projects I've mentioned in the last post, I'm expecting to have one roll out near the end of February other than participating in a certain project by <a href="https://linktr.ee/cantoniaindependenceparty">Cantonia IP</a> and that'll probably be the only project in the first half of 2024 for a lot of personal reasons like grad school and finding a job.</p>

      <p>Also as a formailty in solidarity: check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6syG4FkLZ0Y">this video</a> made by the Cantonian militia from ICCA. I will be joining a local shooting club just to get some training and also learn how to sail a proper boat as well, but obviously these things have to come after I finally gain a solid foothold here...</p>
