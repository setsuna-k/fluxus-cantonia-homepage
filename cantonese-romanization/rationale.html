        <span english>Why design this romanization system?</span>
    </h1>

    <h2>Why romanization?</h2>

    <p>Because Cantonese is not a "dialect". Never was, never will be. The true identity of Cantonese is a thousand-year-old Sino-Kra-Dai creole language with near-zero mutual intelligibility with modern Mandarin.</p>


    <p>
        But why, I hear you asking, why can't you just use Yuhtyúx zèngzì (粵語正字; lit. "Cantonese proper characters")? The thing is, while designing a new romanization for Mandarin seems to be generally considered stupid, doing the same thing for Cantonese is (unfortunately) purely a political statement whose objectives Yuhtyúx zèngzì can never fulfill: the myth of Cantonese being merely a "dialect" is based on (1) the fact that we are all "Han people" (which is false; we are much closer to Vietnamese and other Kra-Dai language users than to northern Han) and (2) the fact that Cantonese is supposed to be only able to be written in Chinese characters (because "it's a dialect"; and when you ask why it's a dialect instead of a language they'll tell you that written Cantonese is the same as written Mandarin; it's one big circular reasoning). Using Yuhtyúx zèngzì is only going to further solidify this myth.
    </p>

    <h2>Why not Jyutping?</h2>
    <p>
        Jyutping uses numbers to denote tones, which is not very neat when used in long text; tones are vital to Cantonese but I certainly wouldn't want to write a number after every single character.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the revision?</h2>
    <p>
        After completing the 2022 version there were a few points that I don't like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There's way too many "h" (so one of the "h" got changes into "x")</li>
        <li>The combination "jy" looks cluttered in syllables like "jyun". I understand "yu" is a whole, single element that represents one sound, it still doesn't look good. (so now it's "yun")</li>
        <li>The "oe" vs. "eo" in Jyutping doesn't look separated enough; they're different vowels: you put your tongue further forward in "oe" (technically it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_rounded_vowel">open-mid <em>front</em> rounded</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_central_rounded_vowel">close-mid <em>central</em> rounded</a>), so now you only have "joe" "choe" (surprisingly seems to be <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chur#Chinese">only used in Hong Kong</a>) and "xoe" instead of "zoe" "coe" and "soe" because [s] tends to become closer to [ɕ] when it's a front vowel. For the same reason "zyu" "cyu" and "syu" in Jyutping becomes "jyu" "chyu" and "xyu" as well and further contracted to "ju" "chu" and "xu".</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Why not Yale?</h2>
    <p>
        I designed the system (the 2022 version) exactly because I couldn't input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic)">macron</a> easily as on smartphones; or else I would've just used Yale. (Maybe oneday I'll make a tool like <a href="http://www.zz9pza.net/tajpi/en/">Tajpi</a> for Esperanto and this whole system would be deprecated; who knows?)
    </p>

    <h2>Wouldn't there be ambiguity if you don't use Chinese characters?</h2>
    <p>
        Well we don't "speak" Chinese characters per se (you don't speak a <em>writing</em> system anyway) but we never find it inconvenient; the Koreans ditched Chinese characters centuries ago and they haven't feel much inconvenience, do they?
